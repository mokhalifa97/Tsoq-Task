## Multi-Tenancy Product Addition

Multi-Tenant Implementation: The approach in this project provides data isolation by assigning each tenant its own database. This design choice is ideal for applications requiring high security, scalability, and tenant-specific data handling.

The tenant databases are created dynamically and associated with a unique identifier, known as the Tenant ID, which is provided in the request header. This ID helps the application dynamically switch between databases based on the active tenant.

# Note: this is a custom implementation for multi-tenancy without using a package like Spatie's multi-tenant package. the package documentation is straightforward and it make it easy to implement multi-tenancy as i sow it but i wanted to build it from screatch to understand the concept in depth. #


## Dynamic Database Switching

- Middleware : The 'TenantDatabaseSwitcher' middleware is responsible for intercepting requests and setting the correct database connection based on the Tenant ID.
- you can make tenant  by running the custom artisan command: php artisan tenant:setup {TenantName} {DatabaseName}.
- For each request, the middleware retrieves the Tenant ID and looks up the database name associated with that tenant.
- In the production environment, it configures the tenant's MySQL database connection.
- In the testing environment, SQLiteâ€™s in-memory database is used to speed up tests and ensure isolation.
